## ðŸ§ª Architecture Overview

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - User uploads `.txt` files via the UI.
   - Files are read and split into manageable chunks using LangChain's `CharacterTextSplitter`.

2. **Vector Store Creation**
   - Embeddings are created for each chunk using `OpenAIEmbeddings`.
   - Chunks are stored in a FAISS in-memory vector database for semantic retrieval.

3. **Retrieval and LLM Integration**
   - A `RetrievalQA` chain is built using OpenAIâ€™s GPT model.
   - User questions are matched against document content using FAISS similarity search.
   - The most relevant chunks are passed to the LLM to generate a final answer.
